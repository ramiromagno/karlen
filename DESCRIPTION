Description: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data
    sets by Karlen et al. (2007) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-8-131>. This package
    provides one single tabular tidy data set in long format, encompassing 32
    dilution series, for seven PCR targets and four biological samples. The
    targeted amplicons are within the murine genes: Cav1, Ctfg, Eln, Fn1, Rpl27,
    Hspg2, and Serpine1, respectively. Dilution series: scheme 1 (Cav1, Eln,
    Hspg2, Serpine1): 1-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, and 100-fold; scheme 2 (Ctgf,
    Rpl27, Fn1): 1-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold and 1000-fold.
    For each concentration there are five replicates, except for the 1000-fold
    concentration, where only two replicates were performed. Each amplification
    curve is 40 cycles long. Original raw data file is Additional file 2 from
